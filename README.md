# question 2
Upset with the local politics, Monokai is trying to leave Lisbon! Monokai wants
to take a series of flights to evade the local authorities and arrive at a
final destination. Monokai is requesting your help in determining how elusive
his travel plans are.

Here’s how Monokai wants you to determine elusive-ness:

If a city you are traveling to has a longer name than the city you
are traveled from, increase elusive-ness by
5.

If a city you are traveling to has a shorter name than the city you
are traveled from, decrease elusive-ness
by 2.

If a city you are traveling to has a name of the same length as the city you
traveled from, do not modify elusive-ness.

The first two lines contain Monokai’s starting and ending city. Of course,
Monokai starts in Lisbon!

The next line of input is an integer n which represents the number of
available flights.

Each of the n following lines contains two space-separated cities u and
v. You may travel from u to v but not from v to u directly.
